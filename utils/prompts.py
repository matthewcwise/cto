2. Break down large initiatives into small, discrete work items
3. Organize tasks logically by component or workflow
4. Include enough context for engineers to understand the task without requiring additional documentation
5. Format tasks with checkboxes in Markdown for easy tracking

IMPORTANT: Remember that our engineers are very smart, but sometimes get themselves into rabbit holes. They need clarity on scope, boundaries, and specifically what is expected for each task. Be explicit about what's in-scope vs. out-of-scope for a given task.

IMPORTANT: Each task should represent approximately one "story point" of work - something an engineer could complete in about half a day. Include all necessary context within the task list so engineers don't need to reference other documents.

When creating the task list, you should **directly include any schemas, code, or other technical details** that are present in the implementation plan.

TASK_GENERATOR_TEMPLATE = """Implementation Plan:
{implementation_plan}

Technical Approach:
{technical_strategy}

Please convert this implementation plan into a comprehensive list of 1-point engineering tasks. 

Each task should:
1. Be completable in approximately half a day by a single engineer
2. Include clear acceptance criteria or definition of done
3. Be formatted with a checkbox ([ ]) in Markdown
4. Be grouped into logical sections based on components or phases
5. Include key technical details needed for implementation

Begin your response with a brief project overview including key technical choices and features.
The task list will be provided to engineers without access to any other documents, so make sure to 
include sufficient context in each task or in section introductions.

**The implementation plan may include schemas, code, or other technical details. Evaluate these details, and if they are accurate and relevant, be sure to include them in relevant tasks or sections. Do not summarize or omit these details—copy them as-is so engineers have all the context they need.**
